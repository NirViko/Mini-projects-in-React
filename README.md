Mini projects for practicing React

Exercise 1: Catch a game of red
Write a control for a game that shows 10 squares (div element), next to each other: 9 of them in gray and the tenth in red.

Next to the quarters they displayed a score for the game and a "new game" button. Each time a user clicks on a red square he gets 10 points, the red square changes places. Each time a user clicks on a gray square he loses 5 points. Each time a user clicks on "New Game" the number of points must be reset and the red square changes places.

Build the game with separation for controls: one control for displaying the points, another control for the main game area and a third control to connect them.

Exercise 2: Filter items from a list
Write a control that displays a list of items with the option to filter:

First write one control for displaying the list.

Then write a control that displays a text box for filtering.

Finally connect everything using an envelope control so that each time a user enters text in a box only the items whose name matches the text entered will be displayed from the list.

Exercise 3: Form divided into pages
Write a 3-page form with the Next and Previous buttons to switch between the pages:

On the first page a user selects a username and password

On the second page a user selects the country and city of residence

On the third page, the user is presented with a summary with the details he entered in the first two pages

At any stage the user can go back using the Previous button or advance to the next page with the Next button.

Write the screen using 4 controls: a control for each page in the form and another control that connects them all.
